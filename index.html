<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>Progressive Enhancement is a web term used for the practice of creating code with the intention of bringing it to as many people as possible. (https://www.freecodecamp.org) Summarises PE with "it gives us basic user experience and cross compatibility across browsers to ensure stability."</p> 
<p>As time moves on, browsers begin to become decommissioned or unsupported over time. PE idealizes the aespect of ensuring stuff like basic content and web functionality should be accesible and working on all type of browsers to ensure a streamlined experience.</p>
<p>PE can be split up into 3 different catagories, sort of like a peanut M&M. Theres your main course, the peanut (Initial HTML), your candy coating (External CSS) and finally your candy shell (Javascript). These all work together in PE to creat a unified web page workflow to ensure functionality across all browsers. I personally believe it is increadibly important to keep practicing PE. It's an overall easier endeavor that allows web developers an easier time to create their websites with a PE design philosophy. No need to create seperate HTML or CSS for different browsers, have a simple system thats effective across all browsers. It's good for buisness as it allows consumers across the internet to access web pages regardless of the browser, and it allows the web developer to experience a relif of stress. </p>

<h3>Segway Reflection</h3>
<p>Going through Web technologies was a unique experience for me. originally, I took this class last semester. I admitidly did not give it the attention it deserved. It wasn't until near the last day of classes when it finally hit me where I sat within the class. I had done close to none of the work, I had barely shown up to class for anything, and I was, realistically, going to fail this class because of my laziness. I didn't think web design was something important at the time. When I had to retake this class, again, I went in with a different mindset. I started to learn about how complex it is in all the things that go into making a website. The audience you have to design for, the html structure, the fonts, the validating; Theres alot that goes into just one website page. </p>
<p>The CSS was the most enlightening part for me. Having to go through your html and divide it into sections, then make the specific code that would alter the html into the way you desire was very difficult for me beforehand. I still have trouble with it but I have a much greater understanding now then when I did. My favorite part was probably the image editing. I already did alot of that in my spare time so it was cool to see it apart of this web course.</p>
<p>The Segway project was a whole other experience in itself. While I don't think I did the best or the most complicated, I feel very happy with what I did do. I feel like I grew exponentially from the first time I was learning CSS. It was a little fun trying to design a website in this manner, with light freedom. It was also a good way to prepare myself if I ever have to work a future in website design.</p>
<p>When making the revised website, I recieved several critiques from my family. Some I was expecting, and some that I wasn't. The critique that stood the most out of me was about the body and content of the home page. My mom, who was the one that gave the critique. She said that the original felt way too busy and I should try to make it more digestable. She suggested to me trying to Align the text to the image rather than having the image above it.</p>
<p>While I didn't think too much of this critique at first, when I actually implamented it, it did make a world of difference to me. One that I thought was for the better. I also recived critiques about the footer and the placement of the links, as well as how the white on certain images, like the segway logo, detracted from the web page. So I fixed those up, and image edited the Segway logo to match more with the color scheme.</p>
<p>Although the changes were msotly minor, I do feel like they made the website better overall when comparing to the original. It's still a little rough around the edges, but for my first time actually attempting this project and giving it the best I could, I feel pretty proud of it. I dont think it's an entirely bad first website project at all.</p>
<p>In closing this out, If there were things in this course I could've done differently, I would've definitly tried to be more ambitious with the segway project or maybe my HTML5 project. If I had more time to work on them, I'd love to keep on trying to push myself to make it better. Maybe I will over the summer break, but for now I'm just ready to rest.</p>
<p>Finally, a quick thank you to my professor. He helped explain Website designing is such a digestible and easy fashion. It was very fun getting to be there in class and have him show us a new thing to learn today about web tech. So if you're reading this (Hopefully) Thank you Mr. Wallace!</p>
