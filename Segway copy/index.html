    <h3>Centaur Concept</h3>
    <div class="image-text-container">
    <img src="Project Resources/centaur_sketch_lrg.jpg" alt="Centaur Concept Sketch" />
    <div class="text">
    <p>Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur combines the best of several technologies to create an innovative whole. The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, Concept Centaur will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.</p>
    </div>

    <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_08_700x500.jpg" alt="Product team testing Centaur in a warehouse" />
    <div class="text">
    <p>From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, to creating new product concepts with the goal of finding a prince among frogs. It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." During this time, engineers and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to prove a concept will work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
    <p>The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a prince, a concept that passed this initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation. </p>

    <h3>What is the Centaur?</h3>
    <div class="image-text-container">
    <img src="Project Resources/centaur.jpg" alt="Picture of the Centaur from the side" />
    <div class="text">
    <p>Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced propulsion and suspension systems, and an intuitive user interface to create a unique four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or four wheels. Its full suspension and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people while maintaining control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact way to explore the world. Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor recreational and commercial applications.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Intuitive user controls:</h4> 
    <p><em>Thumbs forward:</em></p>
    <p>The Centaur's forward and backward propulsion is easily controlled by pushing a thumb throttle located on the underside of the right-hand handlebar.</p>
    <p><em>Pop a wheelie:</em></p>
    <div class="image-text-container">
    <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_06_485x522.jpg" alt="Picture of a rider on centaur popping a wheelie"/>
    <div class="text">
    <p> The Centaur uses dynamic stabilization technology to limit and/or maintain the angle at which the rider experiences the device. What would normally be a dangerous maneuver on a motorcycle or ATV becomes safe and controlled on the Centaur. In addition, the rider can position his/her body in three different ways, which makes for a fun ride. This technology also allows for a high-performance design with a short, compact wheelbase - a combination that traditionally can be very difficult to control.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p><em>Lean forward, go forward:</em></p>
    <div class="image-text-container">
    <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_02_700x500.jpg" alt="Picture of a rider on centaur leaning foward"/>
    <div class="text">
    <p> If you've haven't yet experienced the Segway PT, now is the time. If you have, you know what we mean by intuitive controls. Concept Centaur uses dynamic stabilization in a similar way. When on two wheels, the Centaur is controlled by how the rider shifts his or her weight. To go forward, lean forward. To go back, lean back.</p> 
    </div>
    </div>  
    <h4>Simultaneous mechanical and drive-by-wire steering:</h4>
      <p><em>Smart steering:</em></p>
      <div class="image-text-container">
      <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_c485x574.gif" alt="Picture of Centaur and its front systems. These include the handlebar sensors, the unique linkage system, and the data router to the computer unit in the base of the device."/>
      <div class="text">
      <p>The front two wheels turn left and right mechanically, which is made possible by an innovative linkage system designed by Segway engineers. The Centaur's advanced controls software also allows the rear wheels to turn at different rates in response to data received from the rider's steering direction.</p> 
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="image-text-container">
      <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_b485x759.gif" alt="Picture of Centaur and it's rear systems, the device is popping a wheelie. The illustartion shows off the devices computer boards and the gyroscope."/>
      <div class="text">
      <p>When on two wheels, steering is accomplished in the same manner, by turning the handlebar. Sensors in the vertical portion of the steering column monitor the rider's input and sends a signal to the controller boards, which then issue a command to drive either or both of the rear wheels. Turning rate is coordinated so that even with the wheels off the ground, Centaur follows the path defined by the front wheel angles. This allows smooth transitions between two-wheel and four-wheel operation.</p>
     </div>
     </div>
      <h4>Environmentally friendly:</h4> 
      <p><em>No exhaust:</em></p> 
      <p>Batteries power the Centaur, so there are no emissions during operation. In addition, the Centaur uses regenerative braking, which means the batteries are recharged during deceleration and hill descents.</p>
      <p><em>Quiet:</em></p> 
      <div class="image-text-container">
      <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_11_700x479.jpg" alt="Picture of the motor to project Centaur"/>
      <div class="text">
      <p>Electric motors and an innovative gearbox design result in a quiet ride.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p><em>Low-impact tires:</em></p> 
      <div class="image-text-container">
      <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_a700x507.jpg" alt="Picture of Centaur, highlighting it's tires"/>
      <div class="text">
      <p>The Centaur prototypes use the same non-marking silica-based tires as the Segway PTs'. These tires are smooth, which allows the rider to perform exciting maneuvers while having little impact on the terrain.</p>
     </div>
     </div>
      <h4>Distinctive design, elegant suspension:</h4> 
      <p><em>A profile X-shape:</em></p> 
      <div class="image-text-container">
      <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_13_700x479.jpg" alt="Picture of Centaur from the side, it brings attention to it's 'X' shaped design."/>
      <div class="text">
      <p>The profile of the Centaur creates an "X." Right after the Centaur was crowned a prince by the engineers, they quickly pulled in Segway's industrial design team to integrate their vision into the product's form and function. What resulted is a concept with a sleek minimalist design that elegantly showcases the rider, leaving the simple mechanical elegance of the underlying design visible.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p><em>Three shocks:</em></p> 
      <div class="image-text-container">
      <img src="Project Resources/tech1104segway_12_700x479.jpg" alt="Picture of Centaur from the center. It shows off Centaurs 3 shock asorbing springs."/>
      <div class="text">
      <p>There are three shocks on the Centaur that absorb bumps and help the wheels maintain contact with the ground. There is one in each front "arm" and one in the rear.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p><em>Lightweight:</em></p> 
      <p>Concept Centaur only weighs about 150 pounds and can be easily transported in the back of a large SUV or small pick-up truck. If developed, its light weight would allow for transport on the back of small cars through a hitch-mounted rack, similar to that used for carrying bicycles.</p>
